# Discount Calculator using functions

This Python program, 'Functions.py', defines a function named 'calculate_discount' that calculates the discounted price based on the original price and a specified discount percentage. The function has two parameters:

- 'original_price': The original price of the item.
- 'discount_percentage': The discount percentage (default is 10%).

The script then demonstrates the function with default parameters, assuming a 10% discount on an item with an original price of $100.

To use the function with custom parameters, simply provide the 'original_price' and, if needed, the 'discount_percentage' when calling the function.
